Welcome to CakeManager documentation!
=====================================

Introduction
------------
You are using CakePHP because you want to build web-applications. What does every web-application need? You always need a admin-section to manage all data. And, ofcourse you need a login-system. Sometimes only for the admin-section, and sometimes for the whole application. The admin-section and login costs much time, but it should not be!

The CakeManager offers a default login-system, and a strong admin-section to manage your application. You can manage your roles, members, settings, and the most important part: your own data!
